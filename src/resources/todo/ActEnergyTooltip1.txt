Activation Energy
</h2>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
The activation energy, &epsilon; ("epsilon"), is the amount of energy needed to trigger a process. For example:
<br><br>
a) A change of state: the particles need enough energy to break the forces between them.
<br> 
b) Thermionic emission: if you heat up a conductor, electrons are released from the surface. These electrons need enough energy to escape from the attraction of the positive nuclei.
<br> 
c) Conduction in a semiconductor: semiconductors will only start to conduct once there are electrons in a high-energy state called the “conduction band”, so electrons need enough energy to jump from the ground state to this higher-energy state.
<br><br>
In each of these examples, the activation energy comes from the random thermal energy of the particles. 
<br><br>
The ratio &epsilon;/kT is really important (k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38x10<sup>-23</sup>, T is the temperature in K). When kT is big enough compared with &epsilon;, some particles have enough energy to begin the process.  
You might think, then, that these processes wouldn't happen unless kT&ge;&epsilon;, but it's not that simple. 
If the ratio between the activation energy and the average energy of the particles (&epsilon;/kT) is too high, nothing happens.  
As &epsilon;/kT gets down to somewhere around 15–30, the process starts to happen at a fair rate. Some particles must therefore have energies of 15–30 times the average energy in order to trigger the process. 
<br><br>
Every time particles collide, there's a chance that one of them will gain extra energy above and beyond the average kT. If that happens several times in a row, a particle can gain energies much, much higher than the average. 
To end up with an energy of 15kT to 30kT, a particle would have to get very lucky, so there will only be a tiny proportion of particles with this energy. 
Since there are typically huge numbers of particles colliding billions of times each second, this small fraction still adds up to a large number of particles.
<br><br><br>
You can say particles with different energies are in different energy states. A particle with an energy of kT + &epsilon; is in a higher energy state than a particle with an energy of kT. 
<br>
You can find the ratio of particles in two different energy states:
<br>
The Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-&epsilon;/kT</sup>, gives the ratio of the numbers of particles in energy states &epsilon; joules apart.
<br>
For &epsilon;/kT = 15 the Boltzmann factor is ~10<sup>–7</sup>, and for &epsilon;/kT = 30 it's only ~10<sup>–13</sup>. 
That means that only about one in 10<sup>13</sup> to one in 10<sup>7</sup> particles have enough energy to overcome the activation energy. 
That might sound like a tiny proportion, but you have to remember how fast these particles are moving and how often they are colliding with each other. 
Every time there's a collision, there's an 'attempt' at the reaction, so even with so few particles having enough energy, the reaction can happen in a matter of seconds. 
<br><br>
For any particular reaction, the values of &epsilon; and k are fixed. This means that the only thing that will change the Boltzmann factor is the temperature. 
If you plot a graph of the Boltzmann factor against temperature you get an s-shaped curve like the ones below.
