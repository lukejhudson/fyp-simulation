General Information
</h3>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
The purpose of this program is to provide a sandbox to test your understanding of heat engines, activation energy, and basic particle physics in general. 
Being able to visually see how these processes work and behave should give you more confidence in your understanding of them.
<br><br>
The particles in the simulation are based on hydrogen atoms. This means that the particles have a mass of 1.67x10<sup>-27</sup> kg and a diameter of 5.29x10<sup>-11</sup> m.
<br><br>
The simulation updates the position and velocity of all the particles in what is called an <b>iteration</b>, then waits for a brief period of time before performing another update / iteration. 
When the simulation is running at its default speed it updates the particles 60 times per second. At this speed, the simulation is still running about 30 times slower than real life so that you can keep track of what is going on.
