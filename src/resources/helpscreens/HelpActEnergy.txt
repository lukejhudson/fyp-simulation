<b>Speed Distribution Graph</b>: Percentage of particles against speed (arbitrary units), also known as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 
Note what happens to the shape of the distribution as you adjust the "Wall Temperature" slider (while the gas is not insulated) or move the right wall. 
You should find that as the temperature of the gas increases: the average particle speed increases; the maximum particle speed increases; the distribution becomes more spread out.

<b>Energy Distribution Graph</b>: Percentage of particles against energy (arbitrary units). 
Note what happens to the shape of the distribution as you adjust the "Wall Temperature" slider (while the gas is not insulated) or move the right wall. 
Compare this behaviour to that of the speed distribution graph. 
<br><br>
<b>Boltzmann Factor-Reactions/Iteration</b>: Boltzmann factor against reactions per iteration. 
Note how the shape of the plots changes with different temperatures and activation energy values. 
<br><br>
<b>Clear Graph</b>: Clears all plots from the Boltzmann Factor-Reactions/Iteration graph.
