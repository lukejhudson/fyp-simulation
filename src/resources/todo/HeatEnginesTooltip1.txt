Heat Engines and the Carnot Cycle
</h2>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
The Carnot cycle is a <b>reversible</b> process which provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work, 
or conversely, the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference by the application of work to the system. The Carnot cycle assumes that no energy is lost to wasteful 
processes such as friction.
<br><br>
There are two "heat reservoirs" forming part of the heat engine at temperatures <i>T<sub>H</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> (hot and cold respectively). 
They have such large thermal capacity that their temperatures are practically unaffected by a single cycle. During the cycle, an arbitrary 
amount of <b>entropy</b> <i>&Delta;S</i> is extracted from the hot reservoir and deposited in the cold reservoir. Entropy, <i>&Delta;S</i>, is the amount of heat energy transferred into the system, <i>&Delta;Q</i>, divided by the 
temperature of that system, <i>T</i>. An amount of energy <i>T<sub>H</sub>&Delta;S</i> is extracted from the hot reservoir and a smaller amount of energy <i>T<sub>C</sub>&Delta;S</i> is deposited in the cold reservoir. 
The difference in the two energies <i>(T<sub>H</sub>-T<sub>C</sub>)&Delta;S</i> is equal to the work done by the engine.
