Activation Energy
</h2>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
The activation energy, &epsilon; ("epsilon"), is the amount of energy needed to trigger a <b>process</b>. For example:
<br><br>
a) A change of state - the particles need enough energy to break their bonds.
<br> 
b) Thermionic emission - electrons released by a heated conductor need enough energy to escape from the attraction of the positive nuclei in the conductor.
<br> 
c) Conduction in a semiconductor - semiconductors will only start to conduct once there are electrons in a high-energy state called the "conduction band".
<br><br>
In each of these examples, the activation energy comes from the <b>random thermal energy</b> of the particles. 
<br><br>
The ratio <b>&epsilon;/kT</b> is very important (k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38x10<sup>-23</sup>, T is the temperature in K). 
When kT is <b>big enough</b> compared with &epsilon;, some particles have enough energy to begin the process. 
If &epsilon;/kT (the ratio between the activation energy and the average energy of the particles) is <b>too high</b>, nothing happens. 
As &epsilon;/kT gets down to around 15-30, the process starts to happen at a fair rate. 
<b>Some</b> particles must therefore have energies of <b>15-30 times the average energy</b> in order to trigger the process. 
<br><br>
Every time particles collide, there's a chance that one of them will gain <b>extra energy</b> above and beyond the average kT. 
If that happens several times in a row, a particle can gain energies much greater than the average. 
Only a <b>tiny proportion</b> of particles will be lucky enough to reach an energy of 15kT to 30kT. 
Despite this, since there are typically huge numbers of particles colliding <b>billions</b> of times each second, this small fraction still represents a large number of particles.
<br><br><br>
Particles with different energies are in different <b>energy states</b>. For example, a particle with an energy of kT + &epsilon; is in a <b>higher</b> energy state than a particle with an energy of kT. 
<br>
You can find the ratio of particles in two different energy states:
<br>
The <b>Boltzmann factor</b>, <b>e<sup>-&epsilon;/kT</sup></b>, gives the <b>ratio</b> of the numbers of particles in energy states &epsilon; joules apart.
<br>
For &epsilon;/kT = 15 the Boltzmann factor is ~10<sup>-7</sup>, and for &epsilon;/kT = 30 it's only ~10<sup>-13</sup>. 
That means that only about one in 10<sup>13</sup> to one in 10<sup>7</sup> particles have <b>enough energy</b> to overcome the activation energy. 
Even though this is a tiny proportion, it is important to remember how fast these particles are moving and how often they are colliding with each other. 
Even with so few particles having enough energy, the reaction can happen in a matter of seconds.
