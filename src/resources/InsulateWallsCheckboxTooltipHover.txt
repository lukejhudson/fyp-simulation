When checked, all collisions between the particles and walls are elastic except<br>
when the right wall is moving.
<br><br>
Otherwise, whenever a particle collides with a wall it will gain/lose some energy to
<br>
equalise its energy to the wall temperature. This keeps the average temperature of the
<br>
particles approximately equal to the wall tempearture.
