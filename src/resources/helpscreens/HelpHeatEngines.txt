To read more about heat engines, click on the "<b>HELP</b>" button in the top left of the program when in "Heat Engines" mode, which can be selected using the drop-down menu next to the button. 
<br><br>
By utilising the tools available in the program, the "<b>Single Carnot</b>" and "<b>Continual Carnot</b>" buttons can create a Carnot cycle using the following:
<br>
First time around:
<br>&#9679; The "Restart" button is pressed to reset the temperature of the particles
<br>&#9679; The "Remove Traces" button is used on both PV and TS graphs to clear any unwanted traces on the graphs
<br>&#9679; For best results, the number of particles is set to 250 using the "Number of Particles" slider
<br>
Step 1 (Hot reservoir, uninsulated walls, gas pushing wall outwards): 
<br>&#9679; The container and therefore the volume is made as small as possible; The wall temperature is set to 3000K using the "Wall Temperature" slider
<br>&#9679; "Insulate the walls" is unchecked; "Allow particles to push the right wall" is checked
<br>
Step 2 (Hot reservoir, insulated walls, gas pushing wall outwards): 
<br>&#9679; "Insulate the walls" is checked
<br>
Step 3 (Cold reservoir, uninsulated walls, wall compressing gas): 
<br>&#9679; The container and therefore the volume is made as large as possible; The wall temperature is set to 1000K
<br>&#9679; "Insulate the walls" is unchecked; "Allow particles to push the right wall" is unchecked; The "Move Wall In" button is pressed
<br>
Step 4 (Cold reservoir, insulated walls, wall compressing gas):  
<br>&#9679; "Insulate the walls" is checked
<br>
At the end of each step, the "Add Trace" button is pressed to allow for several different red and blue traces on the graph.
<br><br>
<b>Speed Distribution Graph</b>: Percentage of particles against speed (arbitrary units). 
Note what happens to the shape of the distribution as you adjust the "Wall Temperature" slider (while the gas is not insulated) or move the right wall. 
You should find that as the temperature of the gas increases: the average particle speed increases; the maximum particle speed increases; the distribution becomes more spread out. 
<br><br>
<b>Pressure-Volume Graph</b> (PV): Pressure exerted on the container (Pa) against the volume of the container (m<sup>2</sup>). 
Compress the gas (by moving the right wall either manually or automatically) and see how the shape of the curve changes when you use a different temperature or turn insulation on / off.
Red lines signify that the container was insulated. Blue lines signify that the container was not insulated. 
<br><br>
<b>Temperature-Entropy Graph</b> (TS): Temperature of the gas (K) against entropy (JK<sup>-1</sup>). 
Red lines signify that the container was insulated. Blue lines signify that the container was not insulated. 
<br><br>
<b>Add Trace</b>: This buttons adds a new trace to the graph above it without affecting any of the current traces on the graph. 
<br><br> 
<b>Remove Traces</b>: This button removes all traces on the graph above it and then adds a fresh trace.
