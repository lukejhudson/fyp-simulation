<b>Restart</b>: This button restarts the simulation. 
The number of particles after this button has been pressed will be equal to that of the "Number of Particles" slider. 
The average temperature of the particles will be equal to the wall temperature. 
<br><br>
<b>Pause / Resume</b>: This button pauses / resumes the simulation. 
When pausing, the particles will stop moving and the graphs will stop updating. You cannot interact with the right wall of the container while the simulation is paused.
Upon resuming the simulation, the simulation will continue where it left off.
<br><br>
<b>Move Wall In</b>: This button moves the right wall in at a slow, steady rate until this button is pressed again or the container reaches the smallest volume that it can be. 
This is helpful when trying to produce smooth graphs as it is very difficult to manually move the wall in at a constant rate. 
<br><br>
<b>Move Wall Out</b>: This button moves the right wall out at a slow, steady rate until this button is pressed again or the container reaches the largest volume that it can be.
This is helpful when trying to produce smooth graphs as it is very difficult to manually move the wall out at a constant rate. 
<br><br>
<b>Insulate the walls</b>: When checked, all collisions between the particles and walls are elastic except when the right wall is moving. 
Otherwise, whenever a particle collides with a wall it will gain / lose some energy to equalise its energy to the wall temperature. 
This keeps the average temperature of the particles approximately equal to the wall temperature. 
This is most notable used when creating a Carnot cycle.
<br><br>
<b>Colour particles when reaching activation energy</b>: When checked, the particles will be coloured red upon reaching the activation energy specified by the "Activation Energy" slider.
Note: This checkbox can only be used in the "Activation Energy" mode, which can be selected using the drop-down menu in the top left of the program.
<br><br>
<b>Make particles disappear upon reaching activation energy</b>: When checked, particles will disappear from the simulation upon reaching the activation energy. 
As the high energy particles are disappearing, the overall average temperature of the particles will fall. 
Note: This checkbox can only be used in the "Activation Energy" mode, which can be selected using the drop-down menu in the top left of the program. 
<br><br>
<b>Allow particles to push the right wall</b>: When checked, the right wall will be able to be pushed by the particles. 
Particles that push the wall will lose some of their energy in doing so.
