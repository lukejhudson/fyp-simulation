Heat Engines and the Carnot Cycle
</h2>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
The Carnot cycle is a <b>reversible</b> process which provides an upper limit on the efficiency of any engine. It assumes that no energy is lost to wasteful processes such as friction. 
The cycle is reversible as the engine can convert heat into work (as in a typical car engine), or conversely work can be applied to the system in order to remove heat from it (as in a refrigerator). 
In this simulation we are only considering the first case where heat is converted into work.
<br><br>
There are two "heat reservoirs" forming part of the heat engine at temperatures <i>T<sub>H</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> (hot and cold respectively). 
They have such large thermal capacity that we assume their temperatures are unaffected by a single cycle. 
Figure 1 shows an overview of the model being used (during step 1 of the Carnot cycle). 
During the cycle, an arbitrary amount of <b>entropy</b> <i>&Delta;S</i> is extracted from the hot reservoir and deposited in the cold reservoir. 
Entropy, <i>&Delta;S</i>, is the amount of heat energy transferred into the system, <i>&Delta;Q</i>, divided by the temperature of that system, <i>T</i>. 
An amount of <b>energy</b> <i>T<sub>H</sub>&Delta;S</i> is extracted from the hot reservoir and a smaller amount of energy <i>T<sub>C</sub>&Delta;S</i> is deposited in the cold reservoir. 
The difference in the two energies <i>(T<sub>H</sub>-T<sub>C</sub>)&Delta;S</i> is equal to the work done by the engine.
