You can try this out for yourself in the simulation by pressing the "Single Carnot" or "Continual Carnot" buttons. 
Compare how the graphs produced and the gas itself behave to the images above. 
Remember that entropy is calculated from the heat transfer into / out of the gas. 
The entropy will therefore not change when the container is insulated since no heat is being transferred.
