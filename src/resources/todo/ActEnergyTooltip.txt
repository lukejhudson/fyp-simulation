Activation Energy
</h2>
<p style=\"padding:10;">
Any particle above absolute zero has some thermal energy.
<br><br>
Particles in matter are held together by bonds. The energy needed to break these bonds in a given substance is the activation energy &epsilon; (the Greek "epsilon"). 
<br>
The ratio &epsilon;/kT is really important. When kT is big enough compared with &epsilon;, the bonds are broken and the matter comes apart.
<br><br>
The activation energy is the amount of energy needed to trigger a process.
<br>
e.g.
<br>
a) A change of state: the particles need enough energy to break the forces between them.
<br> 
b) Thermionic emission: if you heat up a conductor, electrons are released from the surface. These electrons need enough energy to escape from the attraction of the positive nuclei.
<br> 
c) Ionisation in a candle flame: the molecules in the air need enough energy to split up into individual atoms and ions. This is a similar process to thermionic emission.
<br> 
d) Conduction in a semiconductor: semiconductors will only start to conduct once there are electrons in a high-energy state called the “conduction band”, so electrons need enough energy to jump from the ground state to this higher-energy state.
<br> 
e) Viscous flow: viscous fluids have strong attractive forces between the particles, causing the fluid to ‘flow' slowly. As you increase the temperature you increase the kinetic energy of the particles. This means they have more energy to overcome these forces and so the fluid will be able to flow more easily. That's why when you've got cold oil in a pan the oil is fairly viscous and doesn't 'run' very easily. As the pan and oil heat up, the oil will flow around the pan much more easily.
<br><br>
In each of these examples, the activation energy, &epsilon;, comes from the random thermal energy of the particles. You might think, then, that these processes wouldn't happen unless k&ge;&epsilon;... but it's not that simple...
<br><br>
If the ratio between the activation energy and the average energy of the particles (&epsilon;/kT) is too high, nothing happens. 
<br>
As &epsilon/kT gets down to somewhere around 15–30, the process starts to happen at a fair rate. 
<br>
So some particles must have energies of 15–30 times the average energy. 
<br>
Every time particles collide, there's a chance that one of them will gain extra energy — above and beyond the average kT. If that happens several times in a row, a particle can gain energies much, much higher than the average.
<br>
To end up with an energy of 15kT to 30kT, a particle would have to get very lucky, so there will only be a tiny proportion of particles with this energy. 
<br>
Because there are normally huge numbers of particles colliding billions of times each second, this small fraction still adds up to a large number of particles.
<br><br>
You can say particles with different energies are in different energy states. A particle with an energy of kT + &epsilon; is in a higher energy state than a particle with an energy of kT. 
<br>
You can find the ratio of particles in two different energy states:
<br>
The Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-&epsilon;/kT</sup> , gives the ratio of the numbers of particles in energy states &epsilon; joules apart.
<br><br>
For an activation energy of &epsilon;, processes start happening quickly when &epsilon;/kT is between 15 and 30, so try these values in the Boltzmann factor. 
<br>
For &epsilon;/kT = 15 the Boltzmann factor is ~10<sup>–7</sup> , and for &epsilon;/kT = 30 it's only ~10<sup>–13</sup>. 
<br>
That means that only about one in 10<sup>13</sup> to one in 10<sup>7</sup> particles have enough energy to overcome the activation energy. 
<br>
That might sound like a tiny proportion, but you have to remember how fast these particles are moving. 
<br>
Think about a reaction between two gases: gas particles collide about 10<sup>9</sup> times every second. 
<br>
Every time there's a collision, there's an 'attempt' at the reaction, so even with so few particles having enough energy, the reaction can happen in a matter of seconds.
<br><br>
For any particular reaction, the values of &epsilon; (activation energy) and k (Boltzmann's constant) are fixed. This means that the only thing that will change the Boltzmann factor is the temperature.
<br>
If you plot a graph of the Boltzmann factor against temperature you get an s-shaped curve like the ones below.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This shape shows that at low temperatures, the Boltzmann factor is also very low, so very few (if any) particles will have sufficient energy to react and the reaction will be really slow.
<br><br>
At high temperatures, the Boltzmann factor approaches 1, so nearly all the particles will have enough energy to react and the reaction will be really fast.
<br><br>
In between, the Boltzmann factor increases rapidly with temperature. So a small increase in temperature can make a big difference to the rate.
<br><br>
The rate of a reaction with activation energy &epsilon; is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, e<sup>-&epsilon;/kT</sup>.
