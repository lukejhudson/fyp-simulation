Step 1: Reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the "hot" temperature, T1 (isothermal heat addition or absorption). <br>
During this step (1 to 2 on Figure 1, A to B in Figure 2) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings.<br> 
The temperature of the gas does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermal. The gas expansion is <br>
propelled by absorption of heat energy Q1 from the high temperature reservoir and results in an increase of entropy of the <br>
gas in the amount {\displaystyle \Delta S_{1}=Q_{1}/T_{1}} {\displaystyle \Delta S_{1}=Q_{1}/T_{1}}.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Isentropic (reversible adiabatic) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output). For this step (2 to 3 on Figure 1, <br>
B to C in Figure 2) the mechanisms of the engine are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose <br>
heat (an adiabatic process). The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an amount of internal <br>
energy equal to the work that leaves the system. The gas expansion causes it to cool to the "cold" temperature, T2. The <br>
entropy remains unchanged.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the "cold" temperature, T2. (isothermal heat rejection) (3 to 4 on <br>
Figure 1, C to D on Figure 2) Now the surroundings do work on the gas, causing an amount of heat energy Q2 to leave the <br>
system to the low temperature reservoir and the entropy of the system decreases in the amount <br>
{\displaystyle \Delta S_{2}=Q_{2}/T_{2}} {\displaystyle \Delta S_{2}=Q_{2}/T_{2}}. (This is the same amount of entropy <br> 
absorbed in step 1, as can be seen from the Clausius inequality.)<br>
<br>
Step 4: Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input). (4 to 1 on Figure 1, D to A on Figure 2) Once again the <br>
mechanisms of the engine are assumed to be thermally insulated, and frictionless, hence reversible. During this step, the <br>
surroundings do work on the gas, increasing its internal energy and compressing it, causing the temperature to rise to T1 <br>
due solely to the work added to the system, but the entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state <br>
as at the start of step 1.<br>
